\arguments{
\item{x}{A \code{ped} object.}

\item{alleles}{A list of length \code{pedsize(x)}. Each element should consist of
one or two integers, representing different colours. Zeroes produce
"greyed-out" alleles.}

\item{symbol}{Either "point" or "text".}

\item{pos}{A vector recycled to the length of \code{labels(x)}, indicating allele
placement relative to the pedigree symbols: 0 = inside; 1 = below; 2 =
left; 3 = above; 4 = right. By default, all are placed below.}

\item{cols}{A colour vector corresponding to the integers occurring in
\code{alleles}.}

\item{cex}{An expansion factor for the allele points/letters. Default: 3 for
points and 2 for text.}

\item{sep}{The separation between haplotypes within a pair, given as a
multiple of the width of a pedigree symbol. Default: 0.5 when \code{pos = 0} and
1 otherwise.}

\item{dist}{The distance between pedigree symbols and the alleles, given as a
multiple of the height of a pedigree symbol. Default: 1. Ignored when \code{pos = 0}.}

\item{labs}{A logical indicating if labels should be included.}

\item{checkFounders}{A logical. If TRUE (default), a warning is issued if a
founder has two equal alleles other than 0.}

\item{checkParents}{A logical. If TRUE (default), a warning is issued if
someone's alleles don't match those of the parents. This a superficial test
and does not catch all Mendelian errors.}

\item{margin}{Plot margins (bottom, left, top, right).}

\item{...}{Further arguments passed on to \code{plot.ped()}.}
}
\value{
The plot structure is returned invisibly.

\description{
This is a pedagogical tools for illustrating the concept of
identity-by-descent, by representing the alleles in a pedigree by coloured
points or letters. By default, the alleles are placed below each pedigree
symbols, but any positions are possible, including inside. (See examples.)
