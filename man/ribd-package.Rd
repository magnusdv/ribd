\title{ribd: Pedigree-based Relatedness Coefficients}
\description{
\if{html}{\figure{logo.png}{options: style='float: right' alt='logo' width='120'}}

Recursive algorithms for computing various relatedness coefficients, including pairwise kinship, kappa and identity coefficients. Both autosomal and X-linked coefficients are computed. Founders are allowed to be inbred, which enables construction of any given kappa coefficients, as described in Vigeland (2020) \doi{10.1007/s00285-020-01505-x}. In addition to the standard coefficients, 'ribd' also computes a range of lesser-known coefficients, including generalised kinship coefficients, multi-person coefficients and two-locus coefficients (Vigeland, 2023, \doi{10.1093/g3journal/jkac326}). Many features of 'ribd' are available through the online app 'QuickPed' at \url{https://magnusdv.shinyapps.io/quickped}; see Vigeland (2022) \doi{10.1186/s12859-022-04759-y}.
