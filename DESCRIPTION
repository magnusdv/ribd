Description: Recursive algorithms for computing various relatedness coefficients, 
    including pairwise kinship, kappa and identity coefficients. Both autosomal 
    and X-linked coefficients are computed. Founders are allowed to be inbred. 
    In addition to the standard pairwise coefficients, ribd also computes a range
    of lesser-known coefficients, including generalised kinship coefficients 
    (Karigl (1981) <doi:10.1111/j.1469-1809.1981.tb00341.x>; Weeks and 
    Lange (1988) <https:www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1715269>),  
    two-locus coefficients (Thompson (1988) <doi:10.1093/imammb/5.4.261>) and 
    multi-person coefficients. This package is part of the ped suite, 
    a collection of packages for pedigree analysis with 'pedtools' as the core 
    package for creating and handling pedigree objects.
