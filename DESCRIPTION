Description: Recursive algorithms for computing various relatedness
    coefficients, including pairwise kinship, kappa and identity
    coefficients. Both autosomal and X-linked coefficients are computed.
    Founders are allowed to be inbred, which enables construction of any
    given kappa coefficients, as described in Vigeland (2020)
    <doi:10.1007/s00285-020-01505-x>. In addition to the standard
    coefficients, 'ribd' also computes a range of lesser-known
    coefficients, including generalised kinship coefficients (Karigl
    (1981) <doi:10.1111/j.1469-1809.1981.tb00341.x>; Weeks and Lange
    (1988) <https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/3422543/>),
    two-locus coefficients (Thompson (1988) <doi:10.1093/imammb/5.4.261>)
    and multi-person coefficients. Many features of 'ribd' are available
    through the online app 'QuickPed' at
