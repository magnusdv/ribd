Description: Recursive algorithms for computing various relatedness
    coefficients, including pairwise kinship, kappa and identity
    coefficients. Both autosomal and X-linked coefficients are computed.
    Founders are allowed to be inbred, enabling construction of any given
    kappa coefficients (Vigeland (2020) <doi:10.1007/s00285-020-01505-x>).
    In addition to the standard pairwise coefficients, 'ribd' also
    computes a range of lesser-known coefficients, including generalised
    kinship coefficients (Karigl (1981)
    <doi:10.1111/j.1469-1809.1981.tb00341.x>; Weeks and Lange (1988)
    <https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1715269>), two-locus
    coefficients (Thompson (1988) <doi:10.1093/imammb/5.4.261>) and
    multi-person coefficients. This package is part of the 'ped suite', a
    collection of packages for pedigree analysis in R. Several methods of
    'ribd' are featured in the online app 'QuickPed' available at
    <https://magnusdv.shinyapps.io/quickped>.
