Description: Recursive algorithms for computing various relatedness coefficients, 
    including pairwise kinship, kappa and identity coefficients. Both autosomal 
    and X-linked coefficients are computed. Founders are allowed to be inbred, 
    enabling construction of any given kappa coefficients (Vigeland (2020) 
    <doi:10.1007/s00285-020-01505-x>). In addition to the standard pairwise 
    coefficients, ribd also computes a range of lesser-known coefficients, including
    generalised kinship coefficients (Karigl (1981) 
    <doi:10.1111/j.1469-1809.1981.tb00341.x>; Weeks and Lange (1988) 
    <https:www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1715269>), two-locus coefficients
    (Thompson (1988) <doi:10.1093/imammb/5.4.261>) and multi-person coefficients. 
    This package is part of the ped suite, a collection of packages for pedigree 
    analysis in R.
