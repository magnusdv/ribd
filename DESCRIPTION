Description: Recursive algorithms for computing various relatedness
    coefficients, including pairwise kinship, kappa and identity
    coefficients. Both autosomal and X-linked coefficients are computed.
    Founders are allowed to be inbred, which enables construction of any
    given kappa coefficients, as described in Vigeland (2020)
    <doi:10.1007/s00285-020-01505-x>. In addition to the standard
    coefficients, 'ribd' also computes a range of lesser-known
    coefficients, including generalised kinship coefficients, multi-person
    coefficients and two-locus coefficients (Vigeland, 2023,
    <doi:10.1093/g3journal/jkac326>). Many features of 'ribd' are
    available through the online app 'QuickPed' at
